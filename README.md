# HamlCoffeeAssets [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/netzpirat/haml_coffee_assets.png)](http://travis-ci.org/netzpirat/haml_coffee_assets)

HamlCoffeeAssets compiles [Haml CoffeeScript](https://github.com/9elements/haml-coffee) templates in the Rails 3.1 asset
pipeline.

Tested on MRI Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, REE and the latest versions of JRuby.

## HamlCoffee

HamlCoffee allows you to write inline [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) in your
[HAML](http://haml-lang.com/) template:

```haml
#cart
  %h2= I18n.t('js.cart.title')
  - if @cart.length == 0
    %p.empty= I18n.t('js.cart.empty')
  - else
    %ul
      - for item in @cart
        %li
          .item
            = item.name
            %a{ :href => "/cart/item/remove/#{ item.id }" }
              = I18n.t('js.cart.item.remove')
```

## Installation

The simplest way to install Guard is to use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/).
Add `haml_coffee_assets` and `execjs` to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :assets do
  gem 'haml_coffee_assets'
  gem 'execjs'
end
```

And require the `hamlcoffee.js` in your `application.js.coffee`

```coffeescript
#= require hamlcoffee
```

### JavaScript runtimes

HamlCoffeeAssets uses [ExecJS](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs) to pick the best runtime to evaluate the
CoffeeScript and generate the JavaScript template.

* With CRuby you want to use a V8 JavaScript Engine or Mozilla SpiderMonkey.
* With JRuby you want to use the Mozilla Rhino.
* On Mac OS X you want to use Apple JavaScriptCore.
* On Linux or as a node.js developer you want to use Node.js (V8).
* On Windows you want to use Microsoft Windows Script Host.

The following sections gives you a short overview of the available JavaScript runtimes and how to install it.

### Node.js (V8)

You can install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and use its V8 engine. On OS X you may want to install it with
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), on Linux with your package manager and on Windows you have to download and
install the [executable](http://www.nodejs.org/#download).

### V8 JavaScript Engine

To use the [V8 JavaScript Engine](http://code.google.com/p/v8/), simple add `therubyracer` to your `Gemfile`.
The Ruby Racer acts as a bridge between Ruby and the V8 engine, that will be automatically installed by the Ruby Racer.

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'therubyracer'
end
```

Another alternative is [Mustang](https://github.com/nu7hatch/mustang), a Ruby proxy library for the awesome Google V8
JavaScript engine. Just add `mustang` to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'mustang'
end
```

### Mozilla SpiderMonkey

To use [Mozilla SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey), simple add `johnson` to your `Gemfile`.
Johnson embeds the Mozilla SpiderMonkey JavaScript runtime as a C extension.

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'johnson'
end
```

### Mozilla Rhino

If you're using JRuby, you can embed the [Mozilla Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/) runtime by adding `therubyrhino`
to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'therubyrhino'
end
```

### Apple JavaScriptCore

[JavaScriptCore](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Carbon/Reference/WebKit_JavaScriptCore_Ref/index.html)
is Safari's Nitro JavaScript Engine and only usable on Mac OS X. You don't have to install anything, because
JavaScriptCore is already packaged with Mac OS X.

### Microsoft Windows Script Host

[Microsoft Windows Script Host](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9bbdkx3k.aspx) is available on any Microsoft
Windows operating systems.

## Usage

You should place all your HamlCoffee templates in the `app/assets/templates` directory and include all templates in
your `application.js.coffee`:

```coffeescript
#= require_tree ../templates
```

Now you can start to add your HamlCoffee templates to your template directory. Make sure all your templates have a
`.hamlc` extension to be recognized by HamlCoffeeAssets.

**Note:** HamlCoffee already generates a JavaScript Template, so there is not need to pass it to the `JST` Sprocket
processor by using `.jst.hamlc` as extension, and if you do, the HamlCoffee templates will not work.

## Configuration

### Template namespace

By default all HamlCoffee templates are registered under the `JST` namespace.

Example:

A template located in `app/assets/templates/header.hamlc` with the given content:

```haml
%header
  %h2= title
```

will be accessible in your browser as `JST.header`. You can now render the precompiled template with:

```javascript
JST.header.render({ title: 'Hello HamlCoffee' })
```

If you prefer another namespace, you can set it in your `application.rb`:

```ruby
config.hamlcoffee.namespace = 'HAML'
```

### Escaping

By default your code block in your HamlCoffee template will be escaped through the `HAML.escape` function that is
provided in the `haml_coffee_assets.js`.

You can set another escaping function in your `application.rb`:

```ruby
config.hamlcoffee.escape = 'App.myEscape'
```

or disable escaping completely:

```ruby
config.hamlcoffee.escape = false
```

Your custom escape function must take the unescaped text as parameter and returns the escape function.
The following example implements only ampersand escaping:

```coffeescript
App.myEscape = (text) -> text.replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
```

### Global Context

HamlCoffeeAssets allows you to configure a global context function that gets merged into the local template context for
each template.

There is a example implementation provided in the `haml_coffee_assets.js` that uses the `extend` function
from these frameworks:

* jQuery
* Underscore.js
* Prototype
* MooTools
* Zepto.js

If you use one of these, than you can simply override `HAML.globals` and return the global HAML context object:

```coffeescript
HAML.globals = ->
  {
    authenticated: App.isAuthenticated()
    isAdmin: App.currentUser.hasRole('admin')
  }
```

If you like to use your own implementation, simply configure your context function in your `application.rb`:

```ruby
config.hamlcoffee.context = `App.globalTemplateContext`
```

or disable the global context completely:

```ruby
config.hamlcoffee.context = false
```

Your custom context function must take the local context as parameter and returns the merged context function.
The following example implementation used the _.underscore extend function to merge an inline defined global
context:

```coffeescript
App.globalTemplateContext = (locals) -> _.extend({}, {
    authenticated: App.isAuthenticated()
}, locals)
```
